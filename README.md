# Formating-Text-Egyptair
This is a Desktop program for Egyptair company ,the purpose of this program to extract data from a huge text message.

  
## Purpose of this program:
  Convert the process that takes long time of reading text message to extract the diserd data and fill the sheet excel of these data into each cell to do it  automatically using a software-desktop-application.

## Technology used :
  I used python to make this program specifically framework called tkinter to build GUI of a desktop application , build-in and standard libraries for processing the     data to put into sheet excel.

## Convert python code to a program(Extension .exe):
  - Install PyInstaller using pip: Open a command prompt or terminal window and type "pip install pyinstaller".
    -  ``` 
       pip install pyinstaller
       ```
  - Open a command prompt or terminal window: Navigate to the directory where your Python script is located.

  - Use PyInstaller to create the executable: Type "pyinstaller scriptname.py"  in the command prompt or terminal window, where "test_tkinter.py" (in this case) is the name of your Python script.
    -   ```
         pyinstaller test_tkinter.py
        ``` 

  - Locate the executable file: PyInstaller will create a "dist" folder in the same directory as your Python script. Inside the "dist" folder, you will find the    executable file.
